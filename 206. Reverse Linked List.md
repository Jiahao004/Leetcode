# Question
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []

# Idea
The idea is quite simple, firstly we can creat two pointers, p and q, they point to the head node and the next of the head node. We initiate the p.next to None.

Each times, we use pointer nxt to hold the node after q, then we make the pointer q point to p, then make the pointer p to point to q, then we point the q to the pointer nxt.
This is one iteration during the process.

This iteration will be ended until nxt is none. Then we just need to point the q.next to p and return q.

Then we think about the starting condition. If the linked list is empty, or the linked list only has one node which means the q is none. 
Under those conditions, the algo cannot be launched.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        p,q=head, head.next
        p.next=None
        while q.next:
            nxt = q.next
            q.next = p
            p=q
            q = nxt
        q.next = p
        return q
```
