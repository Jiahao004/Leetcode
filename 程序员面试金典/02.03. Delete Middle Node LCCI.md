# Question
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

 

Example:

Input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f
Output: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f

# Idea
just replace the node deleted node's val with the val of next node, replace the next node's val with the val of next next node, on and so on
 
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """

        p=node
        while p.next:
            p.val = p.next.val
            if not p.next.next:
                p.next=None
                break
            p = p.next

```
 
 But a more simple way is to replace the current node's value with the value of the next node, then change the current node's next pointer, pointer to the node next to the next node.
 
 ```python
 class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """

        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next
```
