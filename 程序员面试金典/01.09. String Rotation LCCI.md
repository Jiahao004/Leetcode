# Question
Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 (e.g.,"waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat"). Can you use only one call to the method that checks if one word is a substring of another?

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "waterbottle", s2 = "erbottlewat"
Output: True


Example 2:

Input: s1 = "aa", s2 = "aba"
Output: False
 

Note:

0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100000

# Idea
since this question requires the hashmap to record if two string has the same character and each character's frequency is the same, we can use bit manipulation to record.
for each character in s1, we calculate the bit difference with character 'A', and use this difference to do bit left move to variable 1, and add it to the results.
We do the same to the s2, then we compare if the two results are the same.

```python
class Solution:
    def isFlipedString(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if len(s1)!=len(s2):
            return False
        else:
            res=0
            for p in range(len(s1)):
                res+=1<<ord(s1[p])-ord('A')
                res-=1<<ord(s2[p])-ord('A')
            return res==0
```
