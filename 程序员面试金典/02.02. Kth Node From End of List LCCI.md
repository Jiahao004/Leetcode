# Question

Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list. Return the value of the element.

Note: This problem is slightly different from the original one in the book.

Example:

Input:  1->2->3->4->5 和 k = 2
Output:  4
Note:

k is always valid.

# Idea
The idea is quite simple, we can use double pointer to solve this problem. Fristly, initiate two pointers p, q, point to the head node. then we move the q to q.next for k-1 steps.
Then, if we continue moving p to p.next and q to q.next, when q is at the tail, the pointer p will point to the last kth node.

```python3

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def kthToLast(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> int:
        p,q=head, head
        while k>1 and q:
            q=q.next
            k-=1

        while q.next:
            q=q.next
            p=p.next
        return p.val
```
