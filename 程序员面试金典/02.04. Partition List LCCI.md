# Question
Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

Example:

Input: head = 3->5->8->5->10->2->1, x = 5
Output: 3->1->2->10->5->5->8

# Idea
we can record two linked list, one for nodes whose value is smaller than the target, the other for nodes whose value is equal or larger than the target.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        small_head, large_head = ListNode(0), ListNode(0)
        small, large = small_head, large_head
        p = head
        while p:
            if p.val>=x:
                large.next=p
                large = large.next
                
            else:
                small.next = p
                small = small.next
            p = p.next
        large.next=None
        small.next = large_head.next
        return small_head.next
```
