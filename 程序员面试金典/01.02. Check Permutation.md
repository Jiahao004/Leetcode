# Question
Given two strings,write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

Example 1:
  Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "bca"
  Output: true

Example 2:
  Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "bad"
  Output: false
  
Note:
0 <= len(s1) <= 100
0 <= len(s2) <= 100

# Ideas
## 1. Hash Map
We can apply a hash map to count the frequency of each character in s1, then compare with the character in s2

```python
class Solution:
    def CheckPermutation(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        dic = {}
        for alpha in s1:
            dic[alpha]=dic.get(alpha,0)+1
        for beta in s2:
            if beta not in dic:
                return False
            else:
                if dic[beta]==0:
                    return False
                else:
                    dic[beta]-=1
        return True
```

## 2. Bit Manipulation
we can also apply bit manipulation to record the appearance of the characters. Since the bit movement is the power of 2, hence if two string has the same length,
their bit record must be the same iff they are the permutation

```python
class Solution:
    def CheckPermutation(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if len(s1)!=len(s2):
            return False
        else:
            record = 0
            for i in range(len(s1)):
                record+=1<<(ord(s1[i])-ord('a'))
                record-=1<<(ord(s2[i])-ord('a'))
            return record==0
```
