# Q #
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

Example 1:
  Input: s = "leetcode"
  Output: false
  
Example 2:
  Input: s = "abc"
  Output: true
 

Note:

0 <= len(s) <= 100

# Idea
We can apply bit manipulation for this question.
From the question we know that the input character is between a~z, hence the assicII code can be used to mark whether a character is repeated.
We use a int type variable to recode the appearance of the character. Then the bit difference between the input character and character 'a' can be the displacement.

Use the bit difference as the bit movement distance. We apply 'and' operation to verify the apperance. If this character appears before, by and operation, the result is not zero.
Hence we return false. Otherwise the result is zero, then we apply 'or' operation, assign the output of 'or' between record variable and this movement variable to the record,
so the new record is added in.

# Code
``` python
class Solution:
    def isUnique(self, astr: str) -> bool:
        mark=0
        for s in astr:
            move_bit = ord(s)-ord('a')
            bit = 1<< move_bit
            if mark & bit==0:
                mark = mark|bit
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
