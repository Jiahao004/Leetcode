# Question
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16

Example 4:

Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104

# Idea
We can use two pointers point to the two side of the list. for each time, we calculate the volumn of the water, then we move the pointer whose value is smaller to the others towards
the center of the list.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        p,q=0,len(height)-1
        res=0
        while p<q:
            tmp=min(height[p],height[q])*(q-p)
            if tmp>res:
                res = tmp
            
            
            if height[p]<=height[q]:
                f=p
                while f<q and height[f]<=height[p]:
                    f+=1
                p=f
            else:
                f=q
                while p<f and height[f]<=height[q]:
                    f-=1
                q=f
        return res
```
